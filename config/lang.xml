 Translations

 LanguageCode (default: empty)
	the language code associated with the language you want to translate the English display strings to.
	For a list of supported languages and codes, see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh456380.aspx
 
 LanguageFile (default: empty)
	relative path to your input translations text file (read only).  The file includes all the display strings that 
	Gigatrees generates. The file uses a semi-colon to separate the English string on the left and the Translation string 
	on the right.  This can be used by international users (along the with strings found in the <Pages>, <Tags>, 
	<TimelineEras> and <MilitaryEras> options) to translate their website into another language.  Text 
	coming directly from your GEDCOM file is not translated (in most cases). English speakers can also use this option to 
	change the text displayed.  Two files are included in the distribution, 'en.txt', which translates the strings into 
	English and 'lang.txt', which is void of translations altogether.
 
 TranslateFile (default: empty)
	relative path to your output translations text file (write only). This file is used with <AutoTranslate> to save your 
	translations.
	
 AutoTranslate (default: empty)
	Set to "Microsoft" if you want to the free Microsoft Translate API.  Set to "Google" if you want to use the for fee
	Google Translate API.  When enabled, Gigatrees will attempt to translate all English display strings found in the 
	<LanguageFile> from English to the language associated with <LanguageCode> and then write the results to the 
	<TranslateFile>.  It does this by querying the Translation API using YOUR authentication credentials (<TranslateId> 
	and <TranslateKey>). Once a string is translated and saved, it will not be queried again, therefore you must start 
	with file missing any translations you want retrieved.  The distribution includes a file (lang.txt) without any 
	translations that you can use to start with.  Querying will abort on the first failure.
 
 TranslateId (default: empty)
	YOUR translation service authentication id.  You must sign up and create an application to get an id.

	Google Ref: Does not apply
 
 TranslateKey (default: empty)
	YOUR translation service authentication key or secret phrase. You must sign up and create an application to get a key.
