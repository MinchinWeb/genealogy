<!-- =====================================================================================================================
 Project (default: Gigatrees)
	specify the project to build.  There only two projects supported, "Gigatrees" and "VGedX".  VGedX uses the 
	configuration fields located at the end of this file.
	
===================================================================================================================== -->
 <Project>VGedX</Project>

<!-- =====================================================================================================================
 VGedX
 
 VGedXReportTitle (default: empty)
	the title of your VGedX Report
	
 VGedXReportFile (default: empty)
	the filename root of your VGedX Report. do not include the extension, <Extension> is used for this
	
 IgnoreUnusedRecords [INFO] (default: false)	
	do not report unreferenced logical records.  These are usually dead records and can be safely removed.
 
 IgnoreMissingRecords [WARNING] (default: false)	
	do not report referenced, but missing logical records.  This indicates that you have obsolete source 
	references in your file.

 IgnoreDuplicateRecords [ERROR] (default: false)	
	do not report logical records having a duplicate logical record id

 IgnoreUndefinedRecords [WARNING] (default: false)	
	do not report undefined tags.  Gigatrees had added support for many undefined tags, other applications,
	however, have not, so it might be nice to know which record fields might not be supported

 IgnoreUserDefinedRecords [INFO] (default: false)	
	do not report user defined tags.  user defined tags start with an underscore (i.e. _FILE).
	Gigatrees had added support for many undefined tags, other applications, however, have not, so it 
	might be nice to know which record fields might not be supported

 IgnoreMaximumDataLimits [WARNING] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that are longer than their maximum data length requirements.  Most applications 
	including Gigatrees, ignore this requirement.
	
 IgnoreMinimumDataLimits [WARNING] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that are shorter than their minimum data length requirements.  Most applications 
	including Gigatrees, ignore this requirement.

 IgnoreMissingIdReferences [ERROR] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that expect a record id reference, but get none
	
 IgnoreIdReferenceSubstitutions [ERROR] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that expect a record id reference but get data instead.  For instance the GEDCOM alias tag (ALIA)
	is defined to expect a record id reference, but some applications use this to hold an alternate name in the for
	of a textual string.

 IgnoreExcessiveLevels [ERROR] (default: false)	 
	do not report tags with level numbers exceeding 99.  Gigatrees will use these fine.
 
 IgnoreTrailingData [WARNING] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that include trailing data, that is data following a tag that should not have any, for instance
	the NOTE logical record should not have data following its reference (i.e. 0 @N1@ NOTE this text should be on the following line)
 
 IgnoreTrailingSpaces [WARNING] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that include trailing spaces after the final tag. This violates the specification, but causes no harm
	in doing so.
 
 IgnoreUnpairedAmpersands [WARNING] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that have unpaired ampersands.  This like email addresses should be entered with two ampersands (@@) instead
	of just the one.  Unpaired ampersands confuse some applications into thinking that the single ampersands indicates a source reference.
	Gigatrees does not care and handles these correctly.
 
 IgnoreLevelNumberGaps [ERROR] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that have level number gaps.  This should never be enabled.  a Level number gap indicates a major corruption to your data.
 
 IgnoreTagOccurenceLimits [ERROR] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that have more or less occurrences than is allowed.  Most applications 
	including Gigatrees, will use or discard excessive occurrences. Too few occurrences of a critical field can lead to problems.  
 
 IgnoreInvalidDataFormats [INFO] (default: false)	
	do not report tags that have invalid data formats, specifically, VGedX only checks date formats.
 
 IgnoreTagErrorDuplicates (default: false)	
	do not report on records that have already been reported for another record.  This will minimize the error shown while still giving 
	a complete picture of the type of errors found in your GEDCOM file.
 
 SkipProcessingFailedRecords (default: false)	
	do not report errors on the fields of a record already reporting an error.
