<div class="adam-citation_text">Text: {Hi William -
<br>Thanks for making the update to correct my Nana's name and for writing. Â I was wondering if you were family. Â We are distant cousins! Â 
<br>Benjamin and Eliza were my great-grandparents. Â My Nana, Nettie, was two when her father died leaving Gr_Grandma, Eliza, with a 2wk old baby (Emily Eliza) and 9 surviving kids to raise. Â She was one fearsome woman of God! Â Nettie had three sons. My father, Philip Hale Butterfield, Jr. was their oldest. Â My father passed away 8.15.1985 in Portland Maine. Â My uncle John passed away here in California in early 1966 I think it was - I would guess April or May but can't seem to find any info on the web. Â He was quite young and his widow, Eli, never remarried, though she remained very close to my Nana (Nettie) throughout her life.
<br>My parents (Philip Hale Butterfield Jr and Shirley Mae Mottram Butterfield, m 7.21.1949) had three of us: Â Peter Hale Butterfield (12.21.1952) ; Lynn Ann Butterfield (6.14.1957) m: 6.27.1981 to Edward Robert Wong, William Philip Wong (2.15.1987) and twins Gregory Jamison Wong and Amanda Jewell Wong (12.10.1991); Joanne Butterfield (4.9.1959) m: April 1989 in San Jose CA but lives in Portland ME to Joseph Roy, Vanessa Lynn Roy (10.9.1991) and Alexis Nicole Roy (12.28.1994). Â My brother was married twice, not sure of dates. Â First wife: Brenda Birch (married August 1983?) produced Justin Butterfield (9.4.1986) and Ryan Butterfield (unsure of birthdate Jan 14, 1989). Â Peter divorced in early 90s and married Valerie May 8 (1993?). Â Val has two kids but they have no children together. Â Harmony Elliot (10.18.1988) and Dakota Elliot (may 5, 1995).
<br>So that makes Â Emanuel and Catherine, who were my Nana Nettie's grandparents,Â my 2nd g-gr-parents as you had guessed. Â So we are distant cousins. Â Thanks for working on this genealogy, Cousin William. Â I will forward to my siblings so they can email you with any details I have not included. Â I will send also to Uncle Hugh, Nettie and Phil's only remaining living child. Â Each can add corrections or updates by email to you.
<br>Blessings,
<br>Lynn
<br>PS - any idea if the book Pat wrote is still in print or how to get a copy? Â Thanks, William!}</div>
