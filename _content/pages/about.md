This started in April 2006 as a blog with Blogger and a site of
GooglePages, moved to a new domain in July 2007 and went online for the
first time that September.

**Minchin.ca** is a place for me to try out my skill with web
technologies and to have my own little (virtual) space.

* * * * *

There are a number of sections to this website. In brief:

-   **Home** -
    [www.Minchin.ca/Index.htm](http://www.minchin.ca/index.htm) -
    Probably the first page you came across. It looks cool and links to
    a number of other pages on my site.
-   **Blog** - [Blog.Minchin.ca](http://blog.minchin.ca/) - My summary
    of some of the random, different, and more intersting things I find
    of the web, and even in the "real" world. Orginally hosted at
    minchinweb.blogspot.com (all link are redirected to the new
    location), it's still powered by [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com).
-   **Links** - [Links.Minchin.ca](http://links.mincin.ca/) - I've
    discovered the power of [Del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/), and
    wanted to supply a list of my casual readings online. The format
    isn't quite as I'd like; it remains a work in progress.
-   **Geneology** -
    [www.Minchin.ca/GenHome.htm](http://www.minchin.ca/genhome.htm) -
    When I started into geneology a few years back, one of the first
    things I did was check out Minchin domain names on the web. I found
    [Minchin.net](http://www.minchin.net), a site for music equipment
    somewhere on the eastern seaboard in the States. We're related, but
    if I remember right, it's rather distant. If you think we might be
    related, [drop me a note](http://www.minchin.ca/contact.htm) and
    fill me in on the details.
-   **Search** -
    [www.Minchin.ca/Search.htm](http://www.minchin.ca/search.htm) - It
    will allow you to use [Google](http://www.google.com) to search both
    this site and the internet. The ad revenue from here is what funds
    most of this site.
-   **Resume** -
    [www.Minchin.ca/Resume.htm](http://www.minchin.ca/resume.htm) - If
    you're interested in offering me a job, this may where you want to
    start. If you've already decided I'm your man, [send me an
    email](http://www.minchin.ca/contact.htm#careers).
-   **About** -
    [www.Minchin.ca/About.htm](http://www.minchin.ca/about.htm) - This
    page! The idea is to tell you what the different sections of the
    website are about.
-   **Contact Me** -
    [www.Minchin.ca/Contact.htm](http://www.minchin.ca/contact.htm) - If
    you want to get a hold of me, this page will give you the details.
